**Project Documentation: Stream wave**

**Overview:**
Stream wave is a Node.js backend project built with Express.js. It provides functionalities for user authentication, file handling, and database operations.

**Technologies Used:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- bcrypt
- Cloudinary
- Cookie-parser
- CORS
- dotenv
- Mongoose
- Multer
- MongoDB

**Functionality:**
Stream wave offers the following functionalities:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Register a new user.
   - Login with existing user credentials.
   - Logout the currently authenticated user.

2. **File Handling:**
   - Upload files to Cloudinary storage.

3. **User Data Operations:**
   - Fetch all users from the database.
   - Fetch a specific user by ID.
   - Update a user's information.
   - Delete a user from the database.

**Usage:**
To use Stream wave:
1. Set up the project by installing dependencies (`npm install`).
2. Configure environment variables in the `.env` file.

Certainly! Here are the instructions for configuring the `.env` file:

```plaintext
PORT_NUMBER=
```
Set the port number where the server will listen for incoming connections. Choose an available port number, such as 8000 or 3000.

```plaintext
MONGO_URI=
```
Replace this URI with your MongoDB connection string. Ensure it's correctly formatted and contains the necessary credentials to connect to your MongoDB database.

```plaintext
CORS_ORIGIN=
```
Set the CORS origin to allow requests from specific origins. You can specify individual origins or use `*` to allow requests from any origin.

```plaintext
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
```
Generate a strong random string and set it as the access token secret. This secret is used to sign and verify JWT tokens for user authentication.

```plaintext
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=
```
Set the expiration time for access tokens. You can specify it in seconds (`s`), minutes (`m`), hours (`h`), or days (`d`). For example, `1d` represents 1 day.

```plaintext
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=
```
Generate another strong random string and set it as the refresh token secret. This secret is used similarly to the access token secret but for refreshing tokens.

```plaintext
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=
```
Set the expiration time for refresh tokens. You can specify it in the same format as access token expiry.

```plaintext
CLOUD_NAME=
API_KEY=
API_SECRET=
```
These are the Cloudinary credentials. Replace them with your Cloudinary cloud name, API key, and API secret.

After configuring the `.env` file, save it in the root directory of your project. Ensure you keep this file secure and don't expose it publicly, as it contains sensitive information. Once configured, you can now clone the project and run it on your machine.

3. Start the server (`nodemon`).
4. Utilize the provided API endpoints for user authentication, file handling, and user data operations.

**Conclusion:**
Stream wave provides essential backend functionalities for web applications, including user authentication, file handling, and database operations. It leverages Node.js and Express.js along with various utilities to offer a robust backend solution.
